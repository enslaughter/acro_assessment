# Acro Media Technical Assessment
My technical assessment for Acro Media, a strap component for "Outdoor Adventure", featuring a small sign-up form for their newsletter.
The project is constructed in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, however the CSS is compiled from SASS, and FontAwesome was used for the icons.
The handling of the submission message was coded with basic Javascript, replacing the form element with the given message in the design.
