# Acro Media Technical Assessment
My technical assessment for Acro Media, a strap component for "Outdoor Adventure" featuring a small sign-up form for their newsletter.
I followed the given design as close as possible and followed a mobile-first development approach. 
The project is constructed in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, however the CSS is compiled from SASS, and FontAwesome was used for the icons.
The handling of the submission message was coded with basic Javascript, replacing the form element with the given message in the design. 

## To-Do
- Add vendor prefixes in various places to ensure project works on all devices
- Consider improving UI/UX in places not covered by the design file, such as animations or focus states
- Tidy up Javascript for readability and reusability
